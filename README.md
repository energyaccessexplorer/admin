# Energy Access Explorer Admin

This is the frontend code for the platform's admin panel.

## Building & Hacking

The magic is really done by [duck-tape](https://git.263.nu/f/duck-tape). This
repository only contains the EAE's specific code. See duck-tape's documentation
to get started.

You will need the [database](https://github.com/energyaccessexplorer/database)
and [PostgREST](https://postgrest.org/) up and running.

Additionally, [paver](https://github.com/energyaccessexplorer/paver) is required
to get _full enchilada_.
